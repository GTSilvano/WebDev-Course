# My Web Development Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey into web development! This repository is a comprehensive record of my progress as I learn and practice web development, primarily by following along with a Udemy course. Here, you'll find my handwritten code for each lesson, experiments, and personal notes as I build my skills from the ground up.

## About This Repository

- **Learning Approach:**  
  I am currently enrolled in a Udemy web development course. For each lesson, I write out the code myself in VS Code, rather than copy-pasting, to reinforce my understanding. I also experiment and test concepts independently to deepen my learning.
- **Structure:**  
  The repository is organized by topic and lesson, with folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various projects. Each folder contains files and subfolders that mirror the course structure, making it easy to follow my learning path.
- **Purpose:**  
  This repo serves as both my personal study log and a resource for others who may be learning web development. All code is commented and explained for clarity.

## Journey Highlights

- **Start Date:** 27th of March, 2024
- **Current Focus:** JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and building interactive web pages.
- **Milestones:**
  - Completed HTML basics and created several static pages.
  - Learned CSS, including Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.
  - Built mini-projects and practiced with forms, tables, and layouts.
  - Currently working through JavaScript basics, loops, conditionals, and objects.

## Technologies Learned

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Example Projects

### Project 1: My First Webpage

A simple HTML and CSS page to practice structure and styling.

### Project 2: Todo List (in progress)

A basic JavaScript-powered todo list app to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Challenges Faced

Throughout this journey, I've encountered challenges such as:

- Debugging code and understanding error messages.
- Grasping tricky concepts like scope, closures, and asynchronous JavaScript.
- Designing responsive layouts that work across devices.

Each challenge has been an opportunity to learn and improve my problem-solving skills.

## What I've Learned

- The importance of writing code by hand for better retention.
- How to break down problems and debug effectively.
- Best practices for organizing code and using comments for clarity.
- How to use VS Code efficiently as a development environment.

## Goals

- **Short-term:**  
  Complete the Udemy course and build several small web apps.
- **Long-term:**  
  Become proficient in front-end development, contribute to open source, and start building full-stack applications.
